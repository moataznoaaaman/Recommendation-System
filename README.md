# Recommendation-System
A recommendation system for shoppers online, built using Haskell. The repo is comprised of 2 files. One is the main project file. The other is the database used to demonstrate the code. If you wish to use another database, change the import statement in the main file, and make sure the database abides by the expected structure (an example is the DataFile database).
